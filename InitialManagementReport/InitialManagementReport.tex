\section {Introduction} 

This report is designed to discuss our initial prospects for the project and what we have in planned \\
for our final prototype. \\
\\ 
Within this report we will illustrate our Use Cases, Architecture and Sequence Diagrams,  \\
explain our chosen language and provide a project plan to which we hope to follow to   \\
complete our prototype.  \\
\\
We will be designing our report carefully following the Requirements List which has been \\
provided to us:  \\
\\
\indent\indent	1. Reading a correctly formatted Sirca orders file (1 day only) \\
\indent\indent 	2. Choosing an appropriate algorithmic trading strategy and setting its different \\
\indent\indent\indent	 		parameters \\
\indent\indent	3. Generating algorithmic orders for 1 particular day \\
\indent\indent	4. Evaluating algorithmic trades and providing feedback to the user \\
\indent\indent	5. Generating a strategy performance report \\ 
\indent\indent	6. GUI functions to control and use the Use Cases to load and execute orders \\ 
\indent\indent	7. GUI functions to visualise market data (spread, volume and depth) \\
\\
We will also aim to meet the Quality Requirements: \\
\\
\indent\indent	1. Speed of execution \\
\indent\indent 	2. Usability of the GUI \\
\indent\indent	3. Quality of the visualisation \\
\indent\indent	4. Quality of the strategic performance report \\
